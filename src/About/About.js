            <p className="info">With classic influences such as Prince and The Smiths to newer and more unfamiliar artists such as Catfish and the Bottlemen, Night Terrors of 1927, The Griswolds, Alter Bridge, KITTEN and The Hunna, we write original songs and makes covers of those we wish we had. Come to one of our shows and you're sure to hear a song you know, but you'll also discover some you never have.
            We all inspire each other to be the best musicians we can be and push each other to our limits. We all put their ideas together to create the sound we all want.We like to get paid, everyone does, but really we just want people to listen to our music and come to our shows. In fact, we love playing free shows so even our friends who are hard on cash don't have to break the bank. Making connections with other people is one of our favorite parts of making music, so come find us at any of our shows. We love making new friends. <span>Generation Nomad isnâ€™t a band who is going to settle for <span>good enough</span>, we want to blow your mind.</span></p>
